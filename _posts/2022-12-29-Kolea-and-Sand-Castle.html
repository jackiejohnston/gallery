description: This 8 x 10 inch screen print (serigraph) of a kōlea (Pacific golden plover) was made in 2022.
info: Kōlea or Pacific Golden-Plovers migrate all the way to Hawaii after spending their summers nesting in the Arctic. While they are here, their plumage changes to a distinctive black and white "tuxedo" look. These prints were made using screen print stencils and a linocut block print that was turned into a screen.
