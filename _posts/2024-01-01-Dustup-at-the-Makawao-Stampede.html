description: This 16 x 20 inch pastel painting of a rodeo event was created in 2024.
info:
  I enjoy the bewilderment of my mainland friends when I tell them about going to rodeo events in Hawaii and the fact that cowboys (paniolos) have been wrangling cattle in Hawaii longer than in any of the western states. I took the reference photo for this during the team roping qualifications for the 4th of July Makawao Stampede Rodeo at the Oskie Rice Arena in 2023.
