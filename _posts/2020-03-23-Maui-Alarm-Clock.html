description: This 20 x 16 inch pastel painting of Maui's feral chickens with a surfboard in the background was created in 2020.
info: My first trip to Maui involved many very loud chickens that lived next door to where I was staying, hence the cheeky title. Despite some lost sleep, the feral chickens on the island always make me happy when I see them. The frame is made from reclaimed wood by an artisan in Waco, Texas, who gets his material from demolished buildings.<br><br>This piece was donated to the Maui Hand's fundraiser where 100% of the proceeds went to one of its Lahaina employee's who lost everything in the fire and other Maui disaster relief efforts.
