description: This 20 x 16 inch pastel painting of Maui's feral chickens with a surfboard in the background was created in 2020.
info: My first trip to Maui involved many very loud chickens that lived next door to where I was staying, hence the cheeky title. Despite some lost sleep, the feral chickens on the island always make me happy when I see them. The frame is made from reclaimed wood by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/BeamsBoardsBarns" target="_blank">an artisan in Waco, Texas</a>, who gets his material from demolished buildings.<br><br>This piece was donated to the <a href="https://www.mauihands.com/project/disaster-relief-fundraiser/" target="_blank">Maui Hand's fundraiser</a> where 100% of proceeds goes to their displaced artists and the <a href="https://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/maui-strong" target="_blank">Maui Strong Fund</a> to support disaster relief efforts on Maui.
