description: This 36 x 24 inch soft pastel painting of an outrigger canoe in Maui was created in 2018.
info: Hanakao ªo Beach Park (a.k.a. Canoe Beach) near Lahaina is one of many places on Maui where outrigger canoes are launched. I wasn't yet a member of a canoe club or a resident of Maui when I took the reference photos for this painting, but even then I loved the teamwork involved in moving a wa'a up the beach.
