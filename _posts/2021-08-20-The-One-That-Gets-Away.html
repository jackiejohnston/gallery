title: The One That Gets Away
slug: the-one-that-gets-away
description: This 8 x 10 inch reduction linocut print of a Hawaiian stilt was created in 2021.
info: I saw this Hawaiian stilt catch a dragonfly at Kealia Pond and although it doesn't look good for the dragonfly here, it managed to get away in real life.
