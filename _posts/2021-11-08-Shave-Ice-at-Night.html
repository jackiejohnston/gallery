title: Shave Ice at Night
slug: shave-ice-at-night
description: This 24 x 12 inch painting of downtown Lahaina, Maui, was created in 2021.
info: Lappert's was one of my favorite spots on historic Front Street in Lahaina. The red corner shop was always busy with people getting sweet frozen treats, Dole Whip, ice cream or shave ice. I hope they rebuild.<br><br>This piece was donated to the <a href="https://www.mauihands.com/product/shave-ice-at-night-by-jackie-johnston-original-acrylic-painting/" target="_blank">Maui Hand's fundraiser</a> where 100% of proceeds went to their displaced artists and the <a href="https://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/maui-strong" target="_blank">Maui Strong Fund</a> to support disaster relief efforts on Maui.
