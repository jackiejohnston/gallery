title: Shave Ice at Night
slug: shave-ice-at-night
description: This 24 x 12 inch painting of downtown Lahaina, Maui, was created in 2021.
info: Lappert's was one of my favorite spots on historic Front Street in Lahaina. The red corner shop was always busy with people getting sweet frozen treats, Dole Whip, ice cream or shave ice. I hope they rebuild.<br><br>This piece has been donated to the Maui Hand's fundraiser where 100% of the proceeds will go to one of its Lahaina employees who lost everything in the fire and other Maui disaster relief efforts.
