description: This 18 x 18 inch acrylic painting of Hawaiian stilts was created in 2022 and is part of the Hawaii Art in Public Places Collection.
info: I enjoy taking photos of the birds at Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge on Maui and used some of these as references for this painting. My favorite birds there are the endangered Hawaiian stilts with their long pink legs. The name of these endemic waterbirds in Hawaiian is <em>a'eo</em> which means "one standing tall." When I was working on the background and shadows for this piece I was definitely thinking about the gorgeous paintings of artist Wayne Thiebaud and his cakes with blue shadows on white backgrounds.
