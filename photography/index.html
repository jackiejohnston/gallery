        <p>I was the first person in my family to go to college. So imagine my surprise when, after graduating college, I found that my bachelor&#39s degree in psychology from U.C. Berkeley wasn&#39t helping me get a job. I laugh about it now, but it wasn&#39t until I was out of my insulated world as a student that it really dawned on me that a lot of employers cared more about what you could do, rather than what you could learn.</p>

        <p>As a result, I fell back on my skills in photography &#8212; which had been a hobby up until then &#8212; and got a job at a small portrait studio in San Francisco&#39s financial district.<p>

        <p>After a couple of years there, I followed up on a childhood dream of being a teacher and went back to Berkeley to get a teaching credential. However, it didn&#39t take me long to discover that &#8212; at least for me &#8212; teaching was not a dream job.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, it wasn&#39t long before I found a new path. I was visiting family over spring break towards the end of my second year of teaching elementary school in Palo Alto, when I picked up a local newspaper and started looking at the photographs. I told myself, &#8220;I could take photos like those,&#8221; and more importantly, thought it would be something I&#39d really enjoy. So when my contract expired at the end of the school year, I figured destiny was calling.</p>

        <p>I moved back to Central California, and with the help of some community college classes in journalism and photojournalism, along with a subsequent newspaper internship at the <em>Hanford Sentinel</em>, I launched a career as a photojournalist.</p>

        <p>And ironically I ended up working as a photographer at the same newspaper, the <em>Visalia Times-Delta</em>, that had started me thinking of photojournalism as a career path in the first place.</p>

        <p>After a couple of years at that paper and a brief stint at the Sacramento Bee&#39s zoned edition, <em>Neighbors</em>, I decided to move to the Tri-Cities in Eastern Washington state to be a freelance photojournalist (and to be closer to my husband-to-be).</p>

        <p>As a freelancer, I worked for the Associated Press and scores of clients, from the <em>New York Times</em> to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and a lot of publications in between. My longest running freelance client was a regional wine magazine, <em>Wine Press Northwest</em>, where I took the majority of their photos and also did their some of their layouts.</p>

        <p>Along the way, I worked on a coffee table cookbook, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471746851" target="_blank"><em>Northwest Wining and Dining</em></a>, with a Seattle author, Braiden Rex-Johnson. And I worked with San Diego-area artist, <a href="http://scottjacobsstudio.com" target="_blank">Scott Jacobs</a>, on reference photographs that he used to help create several of his photorealistic acrylic paintings. (This was no doubt what sparked an interest for me in creating <a href="/art">my own paintings</a>.)</p>

        <p>In 2013, I started down a new career path in <a href="/code">web developing</a>, and now photography is back to being a hobby for me.</p>
