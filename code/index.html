          In 2013 I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. I was stuck in a dead-end job doing marketing coordination &#8212; mostly graphic design and web design &#8212; for a medical practice. I had taken this job after the financial crisis of 2008 &#8212; and its subsequent hit to print media &#8212; had pretty much put an end to my freelance photojournalism work. I had pondered the possibility of some cool careers like documentary filmmaker and craft brewmaster, but ultimately they'd require me to take a couple years off of work and end up making about the same salary I already was. Fortunately, one day when I came home from work I turned on the TV to listen to while I made dinner and I just happened to catch a PBS news segment about Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. I immediately started researching this intensive program to teach web developers.
