          In 2013 I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. It was time to reinvent myself again. I was stuck in a dead-end job doing marketing &#8212; mostly graphic and web design &#8212; for a medical practice. I had taken this job after the financial meltdown and its subsequent hit to print media in 2008 had pretty much put an end to my freelance photojournalism work. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t afford the time or cost of taking a lot of time off of work to go back to school, so my options were limited. But, fortunately, one day I caught a news segment on TV about <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> in San Francisco. Since I had already been doing web design for several years, this short intensive program to teach web developing seemed like the perfect fit to take my skills to the next level. And to make a long story short, I graduated their program in April 2014 and have been working as a full-stack Ruby on Rails web developer ever since.
