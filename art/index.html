    <h3>Me &amp; Art</h3>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve always loved art. Some of my favorite college classes were art history. My walls at home are overflowing with artwork. And I love spending time looking at art in galleries, museums and books. Oddly, I spent most of my life thinking I was not able to draw or paint beyond the stick-figure or finger-painting level. Still for some reason, during the summer of 2011, I bought a set of pastels and started playing with them. Encouraged by my results, I took a painting class at my local community college that Fall. Since then, painting has become a pursuit that I really enjoy, even though I have way too little time for it. I mostly use my own photographs for inspiration. And it is my love of animals and the ocean that often inspires my choice of subject matter. Currently, I am taking a plein air class through the <a href="https://www.artcenter.edu/acn/" target="_blank">Art Center</a>, and I am trying to love oil paints as much as I do acrylic.
